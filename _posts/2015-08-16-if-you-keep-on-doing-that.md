> If you think that, why don't you just join the Tories?

This is something that has been leveled at just about every Labour politician, candidate and supporter, who isn't a fully paid up member of the #JezWeCan campaign.

I do rather wonder what those who keep suggesting this think what will actually happen if they're successful with this Conservative party recruitment campaign?

Let us imagine, for a moment, that a vaguely centrist Labour politician, say, Simon Danczuk _were_ to get so hacked off with the vitriol being flung his way that he joined the Tories.

Presumably, the Tories would be so horrified by his leftiness that they'd be as unpleasant to him as the rather angrier breed of Corbynite is to someone supporting, say Andy Burnham? Right?

Wrong.

They would welcome him with open arms.

It would be a PR windfall for the Conservatives the like of which we have not seen[^1]. The Prime Minister would make one of his trademark oleaginous statements about how this is a sign that right thinking types were seeing the plain good sense of his One Nation project.

_The Times, Telegraph, Mail_ et al would post toe curling editorials, and coax out indigestibly smug think pieces from their commentators in which the defector is described as "sturdy", "sensible", and (in defiance of Corbyn's trademark) "principled", and _The Guardian_ and _Independent_ will hand wring and clutch their pearls ineffectually.

It would be sold, and bought by the huge swathes of Middle England _that will decide the next election_ as a sign that Labour could not run a piss up in a brewery, and the only rational thing to do would be to vote Conservative to keep these wild eyed idiots out of government.

Corbyn is going to have enough on his hands convincing swing voters without that, don't you think?

So... still want the Blairites to join the Tories? Cause the Tories do.
