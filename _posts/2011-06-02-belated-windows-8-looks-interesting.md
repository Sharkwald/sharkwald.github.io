[Peter Bright has a good write up at Ars Tech](http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/06/microsoft-gives-the-first-official-look-of-windows-8-touch-interface.ars), and [Gruber is sceptical](http://daringfireball.net/2011/06/windows_8_fundamentally_flawed) of how Win 8 can square the circle of software designed to be used on a &#8220;full" PC (mouse, KB, filesystem, etc) being used through the fat finger touch paradigm that Apple&#8217;s brought to the forefront. <!-- more -->

This is almost certainly a side effect of the silos in MS. The OS/UI guys can&#8217;t just tell the Office guys (cause let&#8217;s be honest, Office is the main reason for the &#8220;classic mode" ghetto) to completely re-write their app using the Metro design language. So we have this fudge.

I&#8217;m not entirely convinced that this is as bad as Gruber&#8217;s making out though, as it reminds me hugely of the Classic Mode that Apple used when transitioning from Mac OS 9 to Mac OS X &#8212; a transparent (to the user) compatibility layer to serve as a staging post between major OS versions.  Apple repeated themselves with the Rosetta emulation layer when switching between Power PC and x86.

Win 8&#8217;s classic mode is actually less of a bother than those, since the changes are purely presentational, not architectural, so there won&#8217;t be the performance problems Mac users endured with Classic Mode and Rosetta.

What MS need to do now is follow through in their other silos. I don&#8217;t see a need for the likes of Visual Studio to have a tablet edition, but a touch centric version of Office, in the manner of the iOS versions of iWork, optimised for Metro must be a priority now. I also want to see the abstraction of the file system carried through across Windows 8. Hierarchical folders are dead, metadata is where it&#8217;s at now. MS made steps toward this in the Library model in Win 7, and Apple are making great strides with it on iOS.

The Metro design language is the most exciting thing Redmond have produced in years, I hope they&#8217;ve got the stones to follow it through to its logical conclusion.
