[Wat.](http://www.glassandsex.com/)

Let's think about this.

OK, that's maybe not the most pleasant idea.

Lets _scientifically analyse_ this, in a dispassionate way, due to the high levels of squick.

> See what your partner can see

Yeah, I'm gonna go with lots of pillows and ceilings, to be honest. Failing that, if you are having the kind of gymnastic sex involving lots of preening and admiring each other... well, isn't the point to watch your _partner_? I'm _incredibly_ vain, and yet I can't bear the sight of myself on film doing normal things, like walking in clothes, and speaking. To actually see a small postage stamp video of myself attempting to look sexy in the corner of my eye during grown up times would probably put me off sex for life.

> Connect your phone and watch yourself from any angle.

Oh yes. I'm sure that'd work. What absolutely would NOT happen is this

> Her: Honey... shall we... you know?  
> Him: OK Glass, it's time!  
> Her: Yeah why not, lets make this one to remember![^1]  
> __A pause__  
> Him: Oh hang on! I'll just pair up the phone, we can get a third angle!  
> Her: O...K...  
> __A pause__  
> Him: God dammit bluetooth!  
> Her: It's OK honey, we can jus--  
> Him: No no, I got this, two seconds, two seconds.  
> <A longer pause>  
> Him: Yes! Now, where were we?  
> __Later__  
> Her: Honey, are you looking at yourself in the mirror whilst I'm...?  
> Him: No! No! My head's just pointing that way is all  
> __Later__  
> Him: Could you, y'know, look at something other than ceiling? I want the video to be good!  
> __Later__  
> Her: Ooh!  
> Him: Oh no, hold on a minute, we've knocked the phone over, no I don't care how close you are, this'll ruin the recording!  
> __Later still__
> Him: No, stop again, we've moved, now the camera can only see our feet  
> Her: Ow!  
> Him: What what what?  
> Her: Your Glass is caught in my hair-- NO DON'T YANK IT BACK JESUS I'LL BE BALD. Keep STILL. OK, move left. NO MY LEFT.  

All set to a soundtrack of Barry White.

Ooooooh baby.
