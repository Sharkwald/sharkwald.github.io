And lo, we began to see specs and pricing.

[And lo, it was all over the soddin' place.](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/gallery-the-13-steam-machines-and-all-of-their-glorious-variety/)

I love the concept of a Steam Machine. I'm a PC gamer, in that the games I 
want to _play_ are PC games. I really have no interest in CPU overclocking
potential, GPU shader counts, PSU ratings, or any of the other bumf that
one _has_ to become familiar with if one wishes to play great swathes of 
games on a PC. I crave simplicity, and I've been jealous of consoles for 
that.

I've thought long and hard about making the jump to consoles for that very
reason; buying a box, plugging it in under my big TV, and knowing that any
game released with my console's logo on its box will play sounds like
nirvana, and yet I don't do that because all the kinds of games that I want to
play simply aren't on the consoles. I want to play Battlefield 4 _and_ 
Papers, Please. Assassins Creed 4 _and_ DOTA 2. The PC is the only platform
that can let me do that.

So looking through this collection of initial Steam Machines, with their
prices ranging from $500 to $6000 (not a typo, six _thousand_ dollars),
and their spec sheets of incomprehensible acronyms, I feel a tremendous 
sense of missed opportunity.

Having thought about it, what I was hoping Steam OS and it's accompanying 
machines would do is provide a _standard_. I wanted confidence that if my
gaming machine was "steam certified" and my game was likewise, that I
simply wouldn't have to worry whether I had a the GeForce 660 GTX or the 
GeForce 570 GT inside the box.

Valve have an opportunity here to change PC gaming, genuinely for the 
better, in my view, but they're not taking it. Their hands-off posture[^1]
would be better described as a shocking case of absentee landlordism.

I don't like them hiding behind the over-used concept of "Open", either.
Open _Standards_ are everywhere; they're what allow most modern engineering
to function at all. Openness without a standard is just a chaotic mess,
doing no good at all for the gamers who just want to play.
