            <p>[T]he French team was caught red-handed with a vast medicine cabinet of illegal drugs. Celaya flushed tens of thousands of dollars&#8217; worth of drugs down the toilet â€“ though this would not have been much help if the French police had raided the team, because the toilet was in a camper van.</p>
