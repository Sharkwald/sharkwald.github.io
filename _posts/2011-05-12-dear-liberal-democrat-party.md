I do not wish to hear about &#8220;a more businesslike relationship". To be honest that&#8217;s what I thought you had anyway &#8212; I thought the stuff about &#8220;marriage" was journalistic metaphor, I didn&#8217;t realise you were <em>actually</em> fucking the Tories.
<!-- more -->

I do not feel that I have failed to understand your position, and if you just explained it one more time, in a slightly more convoluted rearrangement of words, I will grasp its wonder and become your bestest pal.

I do not wish to hear about how the coalition was the only thing you could do. But frankly, I get the feeling that you&#8217;re trying to convince yourself of that, more than me. Where there is a will there&#8217;s a way, in politics more than any other field (as Alex Salmond is currently proving), and if you had <em>genuinely</em> wanted something other than full coalition and those precious ministerial limos, you could have achieved it.

I simply want you to stop. Stop doing what you&#8217;ve been doing for the last year and start doing the things you campaigned on. Part of that, for me, and I daresay many others, the biggest part, was that a vote for you was a vote against the Tories tearing the country to shreds. <em>Not</em> a vote for you to cheerfully stand alongside them while they did so, agreeing that it&#8217;s what you both wanted all along.

You can make a start by vetoing the health bill. Not requesting &#8220;significant changes" (are you really going to make Lansley replace <em>all</em> the commas with semi-colons?), vetoing it. Without your votes, it won&#8217;t pass the Commons. So don&#8217;t vote for it. Don&#8217;t abstain. Vote against it.

Hell, don&#8217;t let it get that far. Simply state that you&#8217;ve had a think, and it&#8217;s actually pish, and that it won&#8217;t pass the Commons.

Yes, your pal Dave will be <em>awfully </em>cross, but just remember, he&#8217;s the dude who cheerfully knifed you in the back over the AV vote, and will do so again if feels the slightest urge. So knife him back.

You think the Tories want to go to the country on &#8220;Who do you want in charge of the NHS?"

Best,  
Owen
