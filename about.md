I am Owen Morgan-Jones, a Welsh software developer living in Glasgow
with my wife and son. I mainly use Microsoft .Net and I have a 
particular interest in JavaScript, but I am also interested in
web technologies in general.

I work for Lockheed Martin, but all opinions on this site are my own,
and not endorsed in any way by my employer.

I have a beard, because it's way less effort than regular shaving, but
mainly because it makes me look sexier.
